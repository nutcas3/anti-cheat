This repository houses a Rust implementation of a Content Consumption Tracker contract, specifically designed for the [Arbitrum Stylus](https://arbitrum.io/stylus). 

This contract leverages the performance benefits of Stylus (using **WASM**) to port a Web2 anti-cheat mechanism to a blockchain environment, enhancing the security and trust of content consumption data.
